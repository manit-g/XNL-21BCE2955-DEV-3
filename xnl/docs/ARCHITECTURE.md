# System Architecture

## Overview
This system implements a fully automated AI-powered Kubernetes cluster with blockchain-based CI/CD capabilities.

## Components
1. Multi-Cloud Infrastructure
   - AWS VPC and EKS
   - GCP VPC and GKE
   - Azure VNet and AKS

2. ML System
   - Kubeflow for ML pipelines
   - TensorFlow-based predictive scaling
   - Real-time traffic analysis

3. Blockchain Integration
   - Ethereum smart contracts for deployment validation
   - IPFS for artifact storage
   - Immutable audit logging

4. Security
   - Zero-trust model with Istio
   - HashiCorp Vault for secrets
   - mTLS communication

5. Monitoring & Logging
   - Prometheus + Grafana
   - ELK Stack
   - Custom ML-based anomaly detection

## Deployment Flow
1. Code commit triggers GitHub Actions
2. Smart contract validates deployment
3. Artifacts stored in IPFS
4. FluxCD applies changes
5. ML system monitors and adjusts resources
